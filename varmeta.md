### Pull requests

## Why are you best suited/what is your background (or team‚Äôs if applicable) (applies to all submissions)?
Our team, Team Var Meta, comprises individuals with diverse backgrounds in software development, blockchain technology, and gaming. We have:
- First and foremost, we believe in the vision of Gnoland and we are looking for contribute to build something substantial that we can go long-term with that, so we have our sheer will commitment.
- Members with extensive experience in developing SDKs, templates, and tools, which is crucial for our main objective.
- Blockchain experts who understand the intricacies of the Gno blockchain, enabling us to leverage its capabilities fully.
- Game developers who are proficient in using Unity, a popular platform for creating video games.

In addition, our team has previously worked on similar projects, giving us a deep understanding of the challenges and best practices when it comes to developing applications and games for the metaverse.

## Milestones and overall time frame of your proposal
Milestones are set at a time frame of 6 months.

### Milestone #1 - Gno Unity SDK 
We have already initiated the Unity SDK projects, currently in the 4th week with 20% progression. This milestone will bolster our confidence in our long-term vision of building on Gnoland, and we have dedicated our best engineers to this endeavor.
C# Gno SDK, following the features:
- [x] Key Management 
- [x] API Interactions
- [x] Account Management
- [x] Transaction
- [ ] NFT Management
- [x] Testing & Logging

Unity ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù scene
A mini ‚Äúdemo wallet‚Äù that:
- [x] Allows for key generation/import, and stores the key locally
- [ ] Allows the minting of an NFT, and fetching/displaying it to the user

Note for the VALOR RPG GAME, NFT & COMMUNITY TOOLS FOR GAMES and Metaverse template - these will be integrated after the SDK is completed.

### Milestone #2 - Gamefi VALOR RPG GAME
The project is currently in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage
Features that have been completed include:
- Core gameplay: Basic features of the game, such as movement, attack, and card draw, have been completed.
- Hero: Basic cards for the Assassin character, VFX motion and attack have been completed
- Stages: 90% of the nodes for Campaign 1 have been completed, allowing for the completion of Campaign 1 within 15-20 minutes

Anticipated features include:
- [ ] Completion of the Knight Hero
- [ ] Implementation of a new hero: Mage
- [ ] Addition of skills for each hero
- [ ] Addition of new stages
- [ ] Addition of a hero upgrade system
- [ ] Addition of a reward system for players who complete the campaigns
- [ ] Addition of a player account system through third parties (e.g., Facebook, Google, etc.)

### Milestone #3 - Account Abstraction on Gno
Account abstraction is a specification designed to achieve account abstraction within the Ethereum ecosystem without necessitating alterations to the consensus layer protocol. However, in the Gnoland blockchain, account abstraction employs distinct mechanisms. This document outlines various methods for implementing account abstraction in Gnoland, while also evaluating the pros and cons of utilizing an independent contract versus account abstraction.

Key Features:
- [ ] Transaction Summary: Users get a simple summary of transactions before confirming, helping them understand the transaction's impact.
- [ ] Two-Factor Authentication: Supports two-factor authentication for increased account security.
- [ ] Password Signing: Users can sign transactions using a password instead of a private key.
- [ ] Spending Limits: Users can set spending limits on their accounts to prevent losses from attacks.
- [ ] Cross-Chain Interoperability: It enables creating decentralized applications that work across different blockchains.

### Your idea for fair funding of the proposal
We propose to receive the total grant of 200,000 (50K for Unity SDK, 150K Valor Fantasy game) in 4 stages:
- The first stage: We would receive 20% of the grant immediately after approval.
- The second stage: Upon completion of the Unity SDK, we would receive 30% of the grant. This significant milestone warrants a larger portion of the funding given the technical complexity involved.
- The third stage: Upon completion of the Valor Fantasy game, we would receive 40% of the grant.
- The final stage: The remaining 10% will continue as commitments after 3 months of completing the milestones.

For the Account Abstraction part, we propose a monthly payment of 40K per month, based on discussions about the solution and features to be implemented on Gno. This stage will run concurrently with the other stages.

Our products will always be made public on our repositories. For the second and third stages, we will submit detailed reports and present our products for thorough review. 
We commit to updating our progress and making proposals every two weeks. This way, we ensure transparency and accountability in our use of the grant.

### What do you and the submission bring to the Gno.land platform and community?
- Our submission aims to enrich the Gno.land platform and its community by providing valuable resources for developers.
- With our SDKs, templates, and tools, we aim to streamline the process of developing metaverse applications and games on the Gno blockchain. This contributes to the growth and diversification of content on the platform, which will attract more users and developers.
- By making our products public on our repositories, we promote transparency and collaboration within the community. Developers can learn from our work, contribute to it, and even adapt it for their own projects.
  
In addition, our team is committed to active engagement with the community. We plan to provide regular updates, respond to feedback, and take part in discussions. We believe that our project and our team's proactive involvement will foster a more vibrant and innovative Gno.land community.
